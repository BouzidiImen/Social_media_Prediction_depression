    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "The worldwide accessibility to internet is one of the phenomena that reshapes the world as we know it. Social Media is used by nearly 3.5 billion people, which makes it a powerful tool to influence people, change their behaviour and even cause them mental diseases.\n",
    "With the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it was shown to the world how personal data can be a tool to understand human behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in DSM-5 [1], the possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major depressive episodes. According to WHO(World Health Organisation), Due to suicide, 800000 people die every year which makes it the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds. Depression disorder is then considered a serious public health concern  with more than 264 million people affected worldwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our study focus essentially on harvesting social networks data to detect early signs of depression and hopefully participate in decreasing the rate of suicide worldwide. \n"
